Task:
To determine the Pixel Variations across the Video using Graph with RGB values and Machine Learning Algorithms in C++ from scratch.

Steps I Followed:
1.First, our imports/globals and includes/defines
2.Then imported the video
3.Then creating necessary empty matrices to store image frames
4.Converting each image into three different planes(RGB)
5.Now we start configuring the histograms. Since we are working with the R, G and B planes, we know that our values will range in the interval [0,255]
6.Then we Calculated Histograms
7.Displaying created histograms
8. Normalizing Histograms		
9.Shows the variation of pixels 
10.Displaying imported video with a delay of 15 milliseconds between each frames
